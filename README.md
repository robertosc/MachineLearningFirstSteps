# Roberto's Data Science Portfolio

This repo is indended to contain all my most significant projects related to Data Science. It will mainly contain Jupyter notebooks base on Python3. The main idea is to improve in Machine Learning, Data Visualizations and Deep Learning.

The repo will be mainly organized by topic and datasets, as the idea is to apply multiple techniques from an area to the same dataset.
